    The measurements' results revealed, that the biggest issue with such design of multi-bit storage cell is the narrow region for writing higher resistances, due to the stochastic nature of the switching process of the cells with very similar parameters. A solution to the problem may be to intentionally vary some of the parameters, by using serially connected elements of different sizes. By varying the size, the critical current and resistance of the element may be changed.

    Another vital improvement is to optimise the nanostructurization process in order to minimize the number of non-working elements. This improvement would increase chances to test bigger storage cells as well as produce fully operational miniaturised serial connections.

    With the increased number of storage elements in a storage cell, higher voltage is needed to switch the cell. Another field of improvement would be to decrease resistance of the element, maximize TMR as well as minimise the critical current. Such improvements would lead to the decrease of supply voltage of the memory, but they are most difficult to implement, due to the complex layer structure of the MTJ.
